#A Most unaccountable relation of one Miss Sarah Green, a widow, living at Beesly, in the county of Worcester. Who following the wicked practice of witchcraft for some time, did at last sell herself, soul and body, to the Devil for fourteen years, and when the time was near expired, she being very sad, sent for her two children and some ministers, and discovered the matter at large, desiring their prayers and good endeavours for the recovery of her soul, which was performed accordingly, though to no purpose; for upon the last day of the term, about midnight, April ye 14th, 1747, she was suddenly struck dead by an infernal spirit in the shape of a bear, to the terror and astonishment of all then present. : With the heads of a sermon suitable on this occasion.#
